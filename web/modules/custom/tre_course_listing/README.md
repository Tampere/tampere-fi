# Course Listing App
## Installation

If using _Node Version Manager_ (NVM), you can run `nvm use` to switch to the node version specified in `.nvmrc`.
Install with npm.

```bash
  npm install
```

### Production build

```bash
  npm run build
```

### Local development

This is generally recommended for local development not only because it speeds up the process, but also because it unobscures the component class names when inspecting the elements in the browser.

```bash
  npm run watch
```
